# Car_price_prediction

Predicting car prices using Support Vector Machines (SVM) involves several steps. Here's a general outline of how you could approach this task:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gather a dataset that includes features relevant to car prices, such as mileage, age, brand, model, engine size, etc.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Choose relevant features that are likely to influence car prices. Feature engineering might also be necessary to create new features that better capture relationships.

3. **Splitting Data:**
   - Divide your dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the SVM model, while the testing set will evaluate its performance.

4. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Select an SVM model suitable for regression tasks. SVM can be used for regression by minimizing the Îµ-insensitive loss function.
   - Train the SVM model on your training data. Tune hyperparameters such as the kernel type (linear, polynomial, radial basis function), regularization parameter (C), and kernel-specific parameters (gamma for RBF kernel).

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared to assess its predictive performance on the test set.
   - Perform cross-validation if needed to ensure the model's generalizability.

6. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained SVM model to predict car prices for new data points.
